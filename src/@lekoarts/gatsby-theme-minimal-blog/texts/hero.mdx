I'm Jahde - an engineer, entrepreneur and explorer from the island of Bermuda. I'm currently the founder of **stealth startup** and make a few angel investments every year. I was previously a Software Engineer at [ClassPass](https://classpass.com/) then [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/), and also worked in finance as a Business Systems Analyst at [S&P Global](https://www.spglobal.com/). I'm the co-founder of [Tech808](https://www.fastcompany.com/3052829/how-a-former-fake-rapper-is-inspiring-a-new-generation-of-entrepreneurs), the world's only hiphop inspired tech conference. I founded [Code441](http://www.code441.com/) to teach the next generation of Bermuda technologists. For any inquiries or requests, please contact me below.
